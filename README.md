# summaries plot
code to extract report summaries report data from Computer Lab website, and plot various relevant graphs.
The data is password protected on the lab website, so the graphs or their nature will not be shown,
but anyone with raven access to the relevant pages can run the code themselves to generate some graphs of summaries data on courses
(assuming they do this in chrome - the code requires your chrome authentication cookie - or a small change can be made).

The reports are taken from www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/exams/reports
